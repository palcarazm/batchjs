# Contributing to batchJS

Thank you for considering contributing to batchJS! We appreciate your interest and are excited to collaborate with you. To ensure a smooth contribution process, please follow the guidelines outlined below.

## How to Contribute

### 1. **Fork and Clone**
Currently, we do not require forking the repository. Please clone the repository directly from the [batchJS GitHub repository](https://github.com/palcarazm/batchjs).

### 2. **Branch Structure**

- **Feature Branches**: For adding new features, create a branch from the `develop/vX.Y.Z` that corresponds to the milestone of the feature. If such a branch does not exist, use the nearest available `develop` branch. Name your branch `feat/XXX`, where `XXX` is the issue number. If no issue exists, create one and branch from the closest `develop` branch.

- **Fix Branches**: For bug fixes, create a branch from the `develop/vX.Y.Z` that aligns with the milestone of the fix. Name your branch `fix/XXX`, where `XXX` is the issue number. If no issue exists, create one and branch from the nearest `develop` branch.

### 3. **Commit Messages**
We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages. When you install the project, Husky will add a commit-msg hook to enforce this convention via commit lint.

### 4. **Pull Requests**
- **Template**: Use the provided pull request template.
- **Checks**: Ensure your pull request passes all CI checks. The minimum test coverage is 80%.
- **Approval**: Pull requests must be reviewed and approved before merging.

## Testing and Validation

- **Running Tests**: Execute tests with `npm run test`. Tests are written with Jest, and a minimum coverage of 80% is required.
- **Writing Tests**: Write tests using Jest to ensure coverage meets the 80% minimum requirement.

## Reporting Issues

- **Bug Reports**: Create an issue of type `bug` following the issue template. We will review, categorize, and prioritize the issue as needed. Contributors will be credited in the Release Notes. For support, use the [Discussions](https://github.com/palcarazm/batchjs/discussions) section. For security issues, follow the instructions in `SECURITY.md` and **do not open a public issue**.

- **Feature Requests**: Create an issue of type `feature` using the template provided. We will analyze, categorize, and prioritize the request. Contributors will be credited in the Release Notes. For ambitious features, we may move the discussion to a thread in the [Discussions](https://github.com/palcarazm/batchjs/discussions) section.

## Code Style and Standards

- **Style Guide**: Follow the ESLint configuration file provided in the repository. The style guide may be updated over time.
- **Linters and Formatters**: Use ESLint with Husky's pre-commit hook to enforce code quality.

## Documentation and Resources

- **Project Documentation**: All classes have JSDoc comments that should be updated. Execute `npm run docs` to update autogenerated documentation from JSDoc.
- **Community Resources**: Participate in the [Discussions](https://github.com/palcarazm/batchjs/discussions) section for community support and engagement.
